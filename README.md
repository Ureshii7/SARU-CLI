## **Features**
- 🔍 **Natural Language Interpretation**: Execute Linux commands using human-friendly text, e.g., `"Show me all files larger than 1GB"` instead of `find . -size +1G`.
- 🧠 **NLP-Powered Engine**: Leverages Python-based NLP models for accurate command parsing.
- 🌟 **Customizable**: Add support for your custom Linux commands or aliases.
- 🚀 **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for speed and performance on any Linux system.

## **Future Updates**
- ✅ Context-Aware Commands (CAC): Remember previous commands and adjust execution based on context.
- ✅ Improved NLP Accuracy: Integration with advanced NLP models for enhanced understanding.
- ✅ Multi-Language Support: Allow input commands in multiple languages.
