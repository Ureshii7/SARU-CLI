**Saru CLI** is an intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP)-driven Command Line Interface that bridges the gap between traditional Linux commands and intuitive, human-like instructions. It's designed to enhance productivity, simplify command execution, and adapt to user needs.

---

## **Features**
- **Natural Language Interpretation**: Execute Linux commands using human-friendly text, e.g., `"Show me all files larger than 1GB"` instead of `find . -size +1G`.
- **NLP-Powered Engine**: Leverages Python-based NLP models for accurate command parsing.
- **Customizable**: Add support for your custom Linux commands or aliases.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for speed and performance on any Linux system.

## **Future Updates**
- Context-Aware Commands (CAC): Remember previous commands and adjust execution based on context.
- Improved NLP Accuracy: Integration with advanced NLP models for enhanced understanding.
- Multi-Language Support: Allow input commands in multiple languages.
